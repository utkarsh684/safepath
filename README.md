# Trust Trip: Smart Tourist Safety App

## Overview

Trust Trip is an innovative mobile application designed to enhance tourist safety by integrating real-time data from weather, natural hazards, transport risks, and local incidents. Leveraging IoT devices, machine learning (ML) for route safety scoring, and blockchain for secure user IDs, the app provides personalized, proactive, and reactive safety features. It helps tourists navigate high-risk areas confidently while enabling authorities to manage emergencies effectively.

### Key Features

- Real-time risk alerts to avoid dangerous zones.
- GPS-based SOS for quick emergency response.
- ML-driven route planner with safety scores.
- Multi-modal suggestions (e.g., railway history, crime hotspots, airline records).
- Offline backup support for remote areas.
- Admin dashboard for local incident updates via IoT.

## Problem Addressed

Tourists often face unforeseen risks like natural disasters, crime, or transport failures in unfamiliar destinations. Trust Trip addresses this by combining multi-domain data into a single, trustworthy platform, boosting confidence and promoting sustainable tourism.

## Technical Architecture

### High-Level Components

- **Frontend**: Cross-platform mobile app (Flutter/React Native) with GPS integration and push notifications.
- **Backend**: Node.js/Python server with REST/GraphQL APIs, hosted on AWS/Google Cloud.
- **ML Engine**: TensorFlow/PyTorch for safety scoring; inputs include weather, crime, and IoT data.
- **IoT Devices**: ESP32-based sensors (ultrasonic for river levels, BMP280 for air pressure, rain gauges) using MQTT for data transmission.
- **Data Sources**: OpenWeatherMap, USGS APIs, government crime databases.
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum/Hyperledger for tamper-proof user IDs and personalized scores.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data, Redis for caching.

### How It Works

1. User plans route via app → Backend fetches data from APIs and IoT.
2. ML processes data → Generates safety-scored routes.
3. App displays suggestions and alerts; SOS triggers emergency notifications.
4. Admins/IoT update incidents → Real-time propagation to users.

## Feasibility Analysis

- **Technical**: Feasible with existing GPS, IoT sensors, and ML tools.
- **Data**: Public/commercial sources available (weather, hazards, crime).
- **Scalability**: Mobile-first with offline support; cloud-deployable.

## Potential Challenges & Risks

- Data reliability (delayed updates).
- High IoT costs in remote areas.
- Privacy concerns with location data.

## Strategies to Overcome

- Partner with authorities for verified data.
- Phased rollout starting in high-tourist zones.
- Implement encryption, anonymization, and GDPR compliance.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Python 3.10+.
- Flutter SDK for mobile (or React Native).
- Docker for containerization.
- AWS/GCP account for cloud services.
